# OMG - Oh My Good's Card game

This app is based on the Oh My Goods card game, which is a resource management card game where players compete to build 
various workshops and generate the most money and build the most buildings. 

I really love playing this game and one day decided that I was going to try and build out an web app version so I could
play with my friends online. Also, a lot of the game's systems are difficult to track so having a computer run the calculations
would just make my life that much easier.

The main reason I am building this out, is to practice Object Oriented Programming. The game itself is complex and managing
all the information and game mechanics is very challenging to say the least. But I am looking forward to that challenge, knowing 
that I am going to learn a lot along the way.
